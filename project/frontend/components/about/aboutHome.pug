      h1.title Marike's Organics
      p.description At Marike's Organics, we are passionate about food processing and value addition of products. Our founder, Suhasa A.P.S. Marike discovered his love for food processing at a young age when he made wild mango popsicles for a cooking competition. Since then, he has been exploring the domain of value addition of food products and experimenting with various permutations of fruit-based ice cream flavors.
      p.history Born into a family of farmers, Suhasa witnessed farming and dairy activities at his home from a young age. He would help his family members in the cultivation of a wide range of crops, including Paddy, Areca, Pepper, Banana, Coconut, Mango, Sapota (Chikoo), and exotic fruits like Rambutan, Pulasan, and Butter Fruit. This experience gave him a deep appreciation for the importance of natural, organic food and led him to start Marike's Organics.
      p.approach We believe in keeping things simple and small, focusing on quality over quantity. Rather than manufacturing ice cream for daily consumption and shelf placement in stores, we prepare bulk orders for events and exhibitions. This approach allows us to maintain a high level of quality control and ensure that each batch of ice cream is made with the freshest, most natural ingredients.
      p.products In addition to our ice cream, we also offer a range of other value-added products, including Jackfruit Halwa, Banana Halwa, Banana Flour Cookies, Pickle, and Papad. We are proud to work with women in Puttur (Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka) who make these products at home without the use of artificial flavors and preservatives. By partnering with these women and marketing their products pan India via courier service, we are playing a key role in empowering women engaged in homemade value addition of products.
      p.sustainability We are committed to sustainability and eco-friendliness in everything we do. We use eco-friendly packaging for our products and have even set up an organic food store in Dakshina Kannada, Puttur. We believe that by promoting natural, organic food and supporting local farmers and producers, we can make a positive impact on our community and the environment.
